## RESOURCES

Resources come in three types - military, research, and culture - and can be spent as follows:

### Culture 
- advance standing with any space
### Trade 
- exchange resources with spaces adjacent to spaces you control based on cultural level or trade between players freely
### Recruit
#### - Military units 
- spend military resources in the military phase
#### - Research units 
- spend research resources in the investment phase
### Move Troops (in the military phase)
### Fund Research 
- spend research resources to increase technology track up to the number of researchers you have
### Victory Points 
- spend 1 of each resource type per tile you control to gain 1 victory point

## TILE

- Produces at most two resource types, one more than the other
- Players determine the production allocation of a tile to produce corresponding amounts of resources (x tech multiplier)
Neutral tiles always produce at the middle allocation and use the level of advancement multiplier

## ROUND

### Pay - put resources in bank equal to upkeep costs of military and research units
- If not enough resources to pay costs, layoff ½ corresponding units (rounded up) per deficit
### Distribute
- Move one space on “egalitarian” track
### Military Phase 
- spend resources on military actions until all players pass
### Harvest
- collect resources based on control (move resources from board to player mat)
### Investment Phase
- spend resources on investment actions until all players pass
### Resolve Military 
- military units occupying same spaces enter combat
Production - place resources on board

## MILITARY PHASE

Players take military actions one at a time until everyone passes
Neutral territories always have 3 units

### Military Actions

Move - spend 1 military resource to move up to 3 troops from 1 tile to an adjacent tile
Cannot move out of a space containing opposing units greater than or equal to yours
Recruit - spend 1 military resource to add one military unit to a space you control

## COMBAT
Roll 1d6 for each military unit in an encounter
The side with the higher total eliminates opposing units
If multiple factions occupy the same tile during the military resolution phase, players determine target in turn order until one faction occupies each tile (excluding allies occupying friendly neutral spaces)
Neutral nations must always be the last target

## INVESTMENT PHASE

Take investment actions one at a time until everyone passes

### Investment Actions
#### Spend
#### Trade
- With adjacent neutral space based on cultural level
- With any player at any rate
